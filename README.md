# Linux Trainer

**Linux Trainer** is a beginner-friendly, practical Linux learning repository focused on real-world usage, core concepts, and everyday workflows.

This project is designed for people who want to *understand* Linux — not just memorize commands.

## What This Is

- A structured place to learn Linux fundamentals
- Hands-on explanations with real examples
- Practical workflows you’ll actually use

## Who This Is For

- Beginners new to Linux
- Returning users who want to rebuild fundamentals
- Hobbyists, makers, and tinkerers
- Anyone who learns best by *doing*, not memorizing

## Who This Is NOT For

- Permissions and ownership
- Processes and services
- Package management concepts
- Configuration basics
- Practical troubleshooting

More topics will be added over time as the project evolves.

## How to Use This Repo

- Read sections in order, or jump to what you need

There is no “right pace.”
